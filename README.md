The goal of the analysis is to find trends and risk factors that have a big impact on loan 
performance, like income levels, credit score, and previous credit behaviour. The project 
aims to categorize loan applications according to risk levels (low and high) using statistical 
and machine learning approaches, which would help lenders make better decisions. The 
knowledge gained will balance lending institutions profitability with financial inclusion by 
reducing defaults and facilitating equitable access to credit.
